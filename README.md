## Guile interoperability tests

The purpose of this test is to check the capabilities of Guile as an extensible/glue language.

In order to better understand what the language is capable of and spot critical areas, I'm going to test a basic Python C/API integration

**Disclaimer** I'm a complete n00b about Guile and Scheme in general. I know a bit of Emacs Lisp, a bit of Clojure and that's it. I hope it will do, but if you see strange stuff in the code, don't be surprised.

## What's here

There is a `python` module which, when loaded, provides the following functions:
    
    py-initialize
    py-finalize
    pylong-from-long-long
    pyfloat-from-double
    pyeval-get-builtins
    pyeval-eval-code
    pyfloat-as-double
    pylong-as-long-long
    py-compile-string
    pydict-new
    pydict-copy
    pydict-set-item-string
    pydict-get-item-string
    pydict-get-item
    pydict-del-item
    pydict-del-item-string
    pydict-clear
    pytuple-new
    pytuple-get-item
    pytuple-set-item
    py-incref

and the following constants:

    py-file-input
    py-eval-input
    py-single-input
    
All C code required for the Guile C wrapping around the Python is automatically generated by Guile itself via the incomplete (and probably amateurish) `meta-create-c-binding.scm` script.

`meta-create-c-binding.scm` reads a list of Python C/API definitions from `template.scm` (which is not valid Schemeâ€¦) and generates the appropriate dynamic code, which is then included in the C module code.

I know: SWIG can do this already, but it's still kinda cool because scheme bootstraps itself (anyway this is my opinion on the matter :) ).

## Bugs

Many, here is a semi-updated list of the ones I know:

- automatic code generation doesn't support all combinations of function argumentsand all return types (it can't at the moment generate some PyErr functions for instance)
- functions generated have the same reference counting mechanics of the original Python C/API code (obviously): this is not really a bug, but still more work is required to make the calls really usable
