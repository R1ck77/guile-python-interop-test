## Guile interoperability tests

Guile seems an interesting choice for an extension/embedding language for a couple of projects I have.

I also remember it wasn't that difficult to actually extend the interpreter with a C library.

I want to see if my memory serves me well: I'll do a little test and use it to embed something, probably some bits from another simple language.
